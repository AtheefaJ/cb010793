                <h2>Primary Objectives of the Bentota Turtle Hatchery</h2>

                    <p>Established with the aim of ensuring the survival of sea turtles, the Bentota Turtle Hatchery serves as a sanctuary for sea turtle eggs and hatchlings. The project focuses on rescuing eggs and nesting females, providing them a safe environment for nesting, and safeguarding the fragile hatchlings until they are ready to be released into the ocean.</p>
                    <p>One of the primary objectives of the hatchery is to protect sea turtle nests from natural threats, such as predators and human encroachment. This is achieved by collecting eggs from vulnerable nests along the coast and relocating them to the protected area of the hatchery. The dedicated staff at the hatchery carefully monitor and maintain the temperature and humidity conditions required for the successful incubation of the eggs.</p>
                    <p>Once the eggs hatch, the hatchlings are kept in tanks where they are nurtured until they reach a certain size and strength, ensuring their survival in the wild. Visitors to the Bentota Turtle Hatchery have the opportunity to learn about the different species of sea turtles found in Sri Lanka, including the Olive Ridley, Green, Hawksbill, Loggerhead, and Leatherback turtles. The hatchery also provides educational information on the life cycle, behavior, and conservation status of these incredible creatures.</p>

                    <p>In addition to its conservation efforts, the Bentota Turtle Hatchery actively engages in public awareness campaigns and outreach programs to educate local communities and tourists about the importance of sea turtle conservation. They emphasize the need to protect the turtles' natural habitats, reduce pollution, and avoid harmful activities that endanger these species.</p>
