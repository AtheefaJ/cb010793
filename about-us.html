                <p>Turtles are known for their distinctive featureâ€”their shells. These protective bony shells are made up of two parts: the carapace, which covers the turtle's back, and the plastron, which covers the belly. This incredible armor-like structure serves as a shield against predators and provides support for the turtle's body.</p>
                <p>One of the most amazing things about turtles is their longevity. Many turtle species are known to live for several decades or even over a century. Their slow and steady pace has become synonymous with patience and endurance.</p>
                <p>Through this website, we aim to educate and inspire turtle lovers of all ages about the Turtle population of Sri Lanka. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn more about turtles or a seasoned turtle keeper seeking new insights, we have something for everyone. We offer a wide range of articles, guides, and resources that cover various aspects of turtle care, including habitat setup, diet recommendations, health considerations, and handling techniques.</p>
